# Event Horizon Armada - Organizational History

## Foundation (2948)

Event Horizon Armada was founded in 2948 by three veteran military operators who shared a common vision: to create a professional private military company that could operate where the UEE's bureaucracy could not. The three founding commanders - Atlay, Hunter, and Psykes - met during separate contract work in the Stanton system and recognized the need for a more coordinated, professional approach to private military operations.

**Founding Principles:**
- Military excellence backed by industrial capability
- Lawful operations with professional standards
- Small, close-knit community focus (quality over quantity)
- Equal leadership structure - no single commander at the top

The name "Event Horizon Armada" was chosen to reflect the organization's mission: operating at the edge of known space where conventional forces rarely venture, yet maintaining the discipline and capability of a professional military force.

## The Three Pillars - Division Structure (2948-Present)

From inception, EHA was organized around three specialized divisions, each led by one of the founding commanders:

### Nexus Logistics Corps
**Commander Atlay (NEXUS 1)** established the logistics and engineering division, recognizing that superior supply chains and technical capabilities would be the foundation of all successful operations. Nexus handles:
- Supply chain management and cargo operations
- Engineering and technical support
- Resource acquisition and distribution
- Infrastructure development and base operations

Atlay's doctrine: "Logistics wins wars. Everything else is just noise."

### Morozov Battalion
**Commander Hunter (BRAVO 1)** formed the ground combat division, drawing on his extensive tactical experience. Named after a legendary military commander known for aggressive but disciplined tactics, Morozov Battalion specializes in:
- Foot combat and ground operations
- Direct action missions
- Combat training and readiness
- Security and defensive operations

Hunter's doctrine: "Train hard, fight easy. Morozov doesn't do half-measures."

### VoidWalkers
**Commander Psykes (WALKER 1)** created the space combat division, focusing on ship-to-ship combat and orbital operations. VoidWalkers handles:
- Space combat and fleet coordination
- Fighter and bomber operations
- Air support for ground forces
- Space interdiction and escort missions

Psykes' doctrine: "Space superiority enables everything else."

## Early Operations (2949-2951)

EHA's first contracts were modest: cargo escort missions in the Stanton system, facility security for mining operations, and defensive operations for frontier settlements. The organization built its reputation on professionalism, reliability, and effectiveness.

**Notable Early Contracts:**
- **Crusader Security Initiative (2949)**: 6-month contract providing convoy escort services between Crusader and ArcCorp. Zero losses, establishing EHA's reliability.
- **Lyria Mining Defense (2950)**: Successful defense of mining operations against sustained pirate harassment. EHA's aggressive counter-operations eliminated the pirate threat entirely.
- **Hurston Logistics Support (2951)**: Complex multi-month logistics operation supporting Hurston Dynamics expansion. Demonstrated Nexus Corps' exceptional capabilities.

## The Integration Protocol - AI Command Support (2952)

As EHA's operations grew more complex, the founding commanders recognized the need for enhanced command and control capabilities. In 2952, they initiated the "Integration Protocol" - implementing AI-enhanced command support to augment human decision-making.

**General Vance** - A sophisticated AI command system designed to provide strategic oversight and coordinate between the three divisions. General Vance serves as the "voice of strategy," issuing mission parameters and story arcs that the human commanders execute with full operational authority.

**Division AI Officers** - Each division received an AI operations officer to handle tactical planning and mission coordination:
- Lt. Colonel Morrison (Nexus Logistics Corps)
- Lt. Colonel Van Der Merwe (Morozov Battalion)
- Lt. Colonel Reeves (VoidWalkers)

**Staff AI Officers** - Cross-division support provided by:
- Lt. Colonel Singh (Intelligence)
- Major Chen (Communications/Cyber)

The Integration Protocol was revolutionary - AI officers handled complex planning and coordination while human commanders maintained strategic authority and operational control. This hybrid approach became EHA's signature advantage.

## Current Era (2953-Present)

### The Psykes Departure (2953)

In early 2953, Commander Psykes resigned from EHA command citing personal reasons. His departure was amicable, and he remains respected within the organization. The VoidWalkers commander position remains vacant, with Lt. Colonel Reeves (AI) managing flight operations as acting commander until a suitable replacement is found.

This vacancy presents both challenge and opportunity - EHA continues to operate effectively but seeks a commander who shares the original vision and can lead VoidWalkers to new heights.

### Modern Operations

Today, EHA operates primarily in the Stanton system with occasional operations extending to adjacent regions. The organization has maintained its founding principles:

**Contract Focus:**
- Legitimate PMC operations (EHA maintains lawful standing)
- Military excellence backed by industrial capability
- Professional standards and accountability
- Community-focused membership (targeting ~100 active personnel)

**Reputation:**
- Known for reliability and professionalism
- Respected for combined arms capabilities
- Valued for logistics expertise that enables extended operations
- Recognized for tactical proficiency and adaptable operations

**Current Strategic Objectives:**
- Establish EHA as premier PMC in Stanton system
- Build sustainable logistics infrastructure
- Maintain elite combat readiness across all divisions
- Find qualified VoidWalkers commander
- Expand contract base while maintaining quality standards

## Command Philosophy

EHA's command structure reflects the founding vision:

**Equal Commander Authority** - No single person commands EHA. The three division commanders operate with equal authority in their domains, coordinating as peers rather than a rigid hierarchy.

**AI Augmentation, Not Replacement** - AI officers provide enhanced capabilities but serve human commanders. Strategic decisions remain with human leadership.

**Mission Over Politics** - EHA focuses on executing contracts professionally rather than engaging in factional politics or pursuing illegal operations.

**Quality Over Quantity** - Selective membership maintains close-knit community and high operational standards.

## Looking Forward

Event Horizon Armada stands at a pivotal moment. With a strong foundation, proven capabilities, and innovative AI-augmented command structure, the organization is positioned for significant growth. The VoidWalkers commander vacancy represents an opportunity for fresh leadership and new directions.

As the UEE's influence waxes and wanes across the frontier, PMCs like EHA become increasingly vital. The organization's commitment to professionalism, combined arms excellence, and sustainable operations positions it to thrive in the chaotic but opportunity-rich environment of the Stanton system and beyond.

The founders' vision endures: "Beyond the Horizon, Strength Prevails."
