                                                                             *Event Horizon Armada Charter*

                                                                                   *Preamble*

This Charter establishes the rules and standards that all members of Event Horizon Armada shall abide by. Membership in EHA is a privilege earned through skill and maintained through professionalism. These rules exist to preserve the organization's integrity, protect our reputation, and ensure that every member can operate with confidence in their fellow operators.


                                                                                   *Article I: Membership Standards*

*Section 1 - Recruitment and Vetting*
All prospective members undergo a vetting process designed to identify skilled, professional operators who share our values. We maintain high standards because our reputation depends on every member's conduct.

*Section 2 - Probationary Period*
New recruits serve a 4-week probationary period including training and group operations. At the end of probation, recruits who demonstrate skill, professionalism, and cultural fit are offered permanent positions with the rank of Lance Corporal.

*Section 3 - Operative Status*
Members who need to step back from active duty but wish to remain part of the community may request Operative status. Operatives maintain Discord access, may participate in operations, and can resume active status. Two subcategories exist:
- Reserve: Operatives temporarily away from Star Citizen
- Affiliate: Operatives primarily active with another organization but maintaining EHA ties

*Section 4 - Standards of Conduct*
All members will:
- Maintain professional conduct in all EHA operations and communications
- Represent EHA honorably in interactions with other organizations and the public
- Participate actively in training, operations, and community events

- Respect the chain of command while maintaining open communication


                                                                                   *Article II: Operational Rules*

1. Direct communication between involved parties
2. Mediation by division officers if needed
3. Review by division Commander if unresolved
4. Joint Commander review for cross-division disputes

This Charter may be amended by unanimous agreement of the active Commanders (currently Atlay and Hunter, pending VoidWalkers Commander appointment). Proposed amendments will be shared with membership for feedback before implementation.

Major changes to organizational structure, mission, or values require consultation with the broader membership to ensure alignment with community consensus.


                                                                                   *Closing Statement*

This Charter exists to protect what we've built: a professional military organization that values skill, integrity, and community. These rules are not restrictions - they are the foundation that allows every member to operate with confidence, knowing their fellow operators maintain the same standards.

Event Horizon Armada succeeds when every member upholds these principles. We are only as strong as our weakest link, only as reliable as our least professional member, only as trustworthy as our most careless operator.

Live up to this Charter. Honor your fellow members. Execute missions professionally. Build something worth belonging to.


  "Beyond the Horizon, Strength Prevails."
