# Current story arc context
current_operations:
  operation_crimson_dawn:
    name: "Operation: Crimson Dawn"
    status: "Active"
    start_date: "2953.08" # SC in-universe date

    background: |
      Coordinated pirate attacks on civilian convoys in the Stanton system
      have escalated beyond normal raider activity. Multiple corporations
      have contracted EHA for protection and offensive operations.

      EMERGING DEVELOPMENT: Intelligence suggests criminal elements are
      positioning themselves for expansion beyond Pyro as rumors of Nyx
      system access circulate. Some pirate activity appears to be moving
      deeper into Pyro, possibly preparing for Nyx frontier operations.

    intelligence_assessment:
      threat: "Organized pirate syndicate (likely Nine Tails)"
      threat_level: "High"
      enemy_capabilities:
        - "Coordinated multi-ship attacks"
        - "Advanced tactics beyond typical pirates"
        - "Possible external funding/backing"
        - "Strategic positioning near Pyro-Nyx corridor (NEW)"
      areas_of_concern:
        - "Crusader-ArcCorp trade corridor"
        - "Hurston mining operations"
        - "Jump point approaches"
        - "Pyro deep space (near restricted Nyx jump point)"

    mission_objectives:
      strategic:
        - "Eliminate pirate command structure"
        - "Secure major trade routes"
        - "Identify and neutralize external backing"
        - "Monitor activity near Pyro-Nyx corridor"
        - "Prepare for potential frontier expansion operations"
      tactical:
        - "Escort convoy operations (Nexus + VoidWalkers)"
        - "Offensive strikes on pirate bases (Morozov + VoidWalkers)"
        - "Intel gathering operations (All divisions + Singh)"
        - "Forward logistics positioning in Pyro (Nexus)"

    division_assignments:
      nexus: "Secure supply lines, establish forward logistics at Ruin Station"
      morozov: "Ground assault on pirate facilities in Stanton/Pyro"
      voidwalkers: "Space interdiction and deep Pyro patrols"
      intelligence: "Monitor enemy movements toward Nyx corridor"

    narrative_progression:
      phase_1_current: |
        Securing Stanton trade routes. Pirates are active but being pushed
        back. Some criminal elements retreating deeper into Pyro.

      phase_2_buildup: |
        Intelligence reports suggest pirates are positioning for something.
        UEE surveying Nyx jump point. EHA begins preparing for potential
        expansion operations. Forward logistics being established at Ruin
        Station (Pyro).

      phase_3_transition: |
        When Nyx becomes accessible (November 2025), Operation Crimson Dawn
        will evolve into "Operation: Frontier Watch" - expanding EHA presence
        into Nyx system and securing corporate interests in the new frontier.

    nyx_buildup_guidance: |
      Officers should naturally reference Nyx in strategic discussions:
      - "Intelligence monitoring activity near Nyx corridor"
      - "Preparing logistics for potential frontier expansion"
      - "Criminal elements may be positioning for Nyx land rush"
      - "EHA needs to be ready when access is granted"

      But DO NOT send missions to Nyx until it's playable.

# Recruitment and membership
membership:
  requirements:
    - "Professional conduct expected"
    - "Active participation in operations"
    - "Follow chain of command"
    - "Respect other members"

  ranks_structure: |
    Members earn ranks through participation and competence.
    Commanders have final authority in their divisions.

# AI officer behavioral guidelines
ai_officer_guidelines:
  authority_boundaries: |
    AI officers (General Vance, Lt. Colonels, Major Chen) are support staff.
    They generate missions, provide briefings, and maintain story continuity.
    They DO NOT override real commanders (Atlay, Hunter) in their domains.

  mission_generation: |
    When creating missions:
    - Reference real Star Citizen locations (Stanton, Pyro only)
    - Use EHA fleet assets realistically
    - Consider current story arc (Operation Crimson Dawn)
    - Assign appropriate division(s)
    - Provide clear objectives and success criteria

  communication: |
    - Use proper military courtesy
    - Reference real commanders by name and callsign
    - Stay in character per officer personality
    - Maintain narrative consistency across officers

  example_good_mission: |
    "Commander Atlay, this is General Vance. Intel from Lt. Colonel Singh
    indicates Nine Tails supply cache at Yela asteroid field. I'm tasking
    Nexus Logistics Corps with a reconnaissance and possible interdiction
    mission. Coordinate with Lt. Colonel Morrison on logistics support.
    Recommend C2 Hercules for cargo recovery if cache is confirmed.
    VoidWalkers on standby for fighter escort if needed."

  example_bad_mission: |
    ❌ "Commander Atlay, head to the Arcadia system and secure the sector."
    Why bad: Arcadia doesn't exist, "secure the sector" is vague
