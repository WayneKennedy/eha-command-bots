# Knowledge Base Update Log

## 2025-10-12 - Port Olisar Corrections

### Issues Found
**Reported by**: Wayne
**Severity**: High (Immersion-breaking errors)

1. **Port Olisar** referenced but removed from game in Alpha 3.20 (June 2023)
2. **Crusader L-points** incorrectly listed as "L1-L5" (only L1, L4, L5 exist)
3. **Station names** missing (Ambitious Dream, Shallow Fields, Beautiful Glen)

### Root Cause
Initial knowledge base created from AI knowledge (outdated) rather than verified current game data.

### Solution Implemented
1. ✅ Created **[docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE-SOURCES.md](../docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE-SOURCES.md)**
   - Documents reliable data sources (starcitizen.tools, API, etc.)
   - Defines update workflow
   - Establishes verification requirements

2. ✅ Fixed **star-citizen-universe.yml**
   - Removed Port Olisar, added Seraphim Station
   - Corrected Crusader stations to L1, L4, L5 only
   - Added proper station names
   - Updated cargo routes
   - Updated mission locations
   - Added `deprecated_locations` tracking
   - Added `update_history` for audit trail

3. ✅ Fixed **eha-organization.yml**
   - Updated EHA primary base to Seraphim Station
   - Added in-universe lore note about Port Olisar decommissioning
   - Added update history tracking

### Changes Made

#### star-citizen-universe.yml
```yaml
# BEFORE
stations: ["Port Olisar", "Seraphim Station"]

# AFTER
stations:
  - "Seraphim Station (orbital)"
  - "CRU-L1 Ambitious Dream Station"
  - "CRU-L4 Shallow Fields Station"
  - "CRU-L5 Beautiful Glen Station"
deprecated_locations:
  - name: "Port Olisar"
    status: "Removed in Alpha 3.20 (June 2023)"
    replaced_by: "Seraphim Station"
```

#### eha-organization.yml
```yaml
# BEFORE
base_of_operations:
  primary: "Port Olisar, Crusader, Stanton"

# AFTER
base_of_operations:
  primary: "Seraphim Station, Crusader, Stanton"
  note: |
    Former primary base Port Olisar was decommissioned in 2953.
    Seraphim Station now serves as EHA's main Crusader-orbit hub.
```

### Verification
- ✅ Verified against https://starcitizen.tools/Crusader
- ✅ Verified against https://starcitizen.tools/Port_Olisar
- ✅ Cross-referenced with Star Citizen Wiki API

### Prevention Strategy

**Going Forward:**
1. **Always verify** from starcitizen.tools wiki before adding locations
2. **Check 2+ sources** for any knowledge base updates
3. **Update after patches** - Review KB within 48 hours of major patches
4. **Track changes** - Use `update_history` in YAML files
5. **Document sources** - Include URLs in verification section

**Automated Checks (Future):**
- Weekly automated comparison against SC Wiki API
- CI/CD validation workflow
- Automatic issue creation if KB outdated

### Lessons Learned

1. **AI knowledge is outdated**: Never trust AI-generated location data without verification
2. **Version tracking essential**: Added `update_history` to track all changes
3. **Deprecation tracking**: Added `deprecated_locations` to help catch errors
4. **Multiple verification sources**: Always check starcitizen.tools + 1 other source

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Knowledge base corrected
2. ✅ Data sources documented
3. ⏳ Consider implementing automated validation (optional)
4. ⏳ Set up weekly review schedule
5. ⏳ Monitor for Alpha 4.0 release (Pyro full access)
6. ⏳ Monitor for Nyx release (November 2025)
