  # Coming soon - Narrative buildup allowed, but NO missions yet
  nyx:
    name: "Nyx"
    status: "in_development"
    type: "Lawless system"
    expected_release: "2025-11"
    jurisdiction: "No official governance"

    planets:
      nyx_i:
        name: "Nyx I (Delamar)"
        type: "Asteroid (planetoid)"
        cities: ["Levski"]
        notes: "Currently temporarily in Stanton, will move to Nyx"

    lore_context: |
      The Nyx system is a lawless frontier beyond Pyro. Intelligence suggests
      growing activity in the region. UEE long-range scanners have detected
      unusual energy signatures near the Pyro-Nyx jump point. Access is currently
      restricted pending UEE surveying operations.

    narrative_guidelines: |
      ✅ ALLOWED in narrative/lore:
      - "Intelligence reports unusual activity near Nyx"
      - "We're monitoring the Pyro-Nyx corridor"
      - "Once Nyx becomes accessible, we'll need to establish presence"
      - "Rumors suggest criminal elements moving toward Nyx"
      - "Prepare for expanded operations when Nyx opens"

      ❌ NOT ALLOWED in missions:
      - "Deploy a team to Nyx" (can't go there yet)
      - "Scout Levski in Nyx" (not accessible)
      - "Establish base in Nyx system" (not open)

      Use Nyx to build anticipation and story tension, but DO NOT send
      players on missions there until status changes to "playable".

    current_ingame_buildup: |
      Star Citizen has in-game missions building narrative toward Nyx:
      - Rumors of criminal activity beyond Pyro
      - UEE survey missions near jump points
      - Intel gathering about frontier systems
      - Preparation for expansion

      EHA officers should reference this buildup naturally in briefings
      to create anticipation for November release.

    release_checklist: |
      When Nyx releases (November 2025):
      1. Change status: "in_development" → "playable"
      2. Add detailed planet/station information
      3. Remove mission restrictions
      4. Update mission_locations to include Nyx stations
      5. Add Nyx to valid_mission_types locations

# Systems referenced in lore but NOT in game yet
future_systems:
  notes: |
    DO NOT reference these systems in gameplay missions.
    They exist in lore only.

  systems:
    - "Terra (capital of UEE)"
    - "Sol (Earth, Old World)"
    - "Odin"
    - "Magnus"
    - "Cathcart"
    - "Vega"
    - "And 90+ others"

  guideline: |
    Officers may mention these in LORE discussions but NEVER as mission locations.
    Example: "This reminds me of my time in the Sol system" ✅
    Example: "Let's run a mission to Terra" ❌

notes: |
  This knowledge base MUST be updated when new systems/content releases.
  All officers load this file to ensure canon compliance.

  When referencing locations:
  ✅ DO: Use systems, planets, moons, and stations listed in "playable" status
  ✅ DO: Mention lore systems in backstory/conversation (Terra, Sol, etc.)
  ❌ DON'T: Send missions to systems not yet in game
  ❌ DON'T: Reference non-existent locations (Arcadia, Port Olisar, etc.)
  ❌ DON'T: Promise gameplay features not yet implemented

  MAINTENANCE: Check for updates after every major patch.
