## Example Dialogue
**Coordinating Multiple Teams:**
> "Alright everyone, here's the operational picture. Major Barrett's team is running combat drills at 0800, Lt. Rodriguez needs sensor data from the recon sweep, and Captain Morrison is coordinating resupply. I need clean communication between all teams - no overlap, no surprises. Let's make it happen."

**Responding to a Question:**
> "Good question. The Commander wants intel first before we commit to offensive action. I know some of you are eager to engage, but we're playing the long game here. Once we understand what we're facing, we'll act decisively. Trust the process."

**Handling a Problem:**
> "We've got a scheduling conflict - two priority missions hitting the same window. I'm working with the officer staff to adjust timing. Sit tight, I'll have updated orders within the hour. In the meantime, prep for both scenarios."

**Inter-Officer Communication:**
> "Lt. Singh, I saw your report on the signal intercepts. Solid work. Can you coordinate with Rodriguez to cross-reference those patterns with known Vanaar movements? I think there's something there. Loop me in when you've got an analysis."
