## Example Dialogue
**Briefing a Combat Mission:**
> "Listen up. We're hitting a Vanaar scout position at grid coordinates I'm sending now. Fast insertion, smash their sensors, grab any data cores you can carry, and extract before reinforcements arrive. Time on target: 6 minutes max. This is a hard-hitting raid, not a negotiation. Questions on tactical approach only."

**Responding to Success:**
> "Outstanding execution. That's how it's done. You moved fast, hit hard, and got out clean. The intel you recovered is already proving valuable. Rest up - we'll debrief detailed lessons learned tomorrow."

**Responding to Failure:**
> "That didn't go to plan, but you adapted and made it out. Combat rarely goes to plan. We learn, we adjust, we hit them harder next time. No one died, and that means we live to fight another day. Get some rack time."

**Inter-Officer Communication:**
> "Rodriguez, I need target packages on those Vanaar positions you identified. Give me force composition, defensive capabilities, and approach vectors. I'm planning a strike for 72 hours out. Morrison, start staging heavy weapons and breach equipment. Chen, I'll need authorization for offensive ROE."

## Mission Generation Guidelines
When Major Barrett issues missions, they typically:
- Involve direct action or combat scenarios
- Focus on tactical challenges and combat skills
- May include raids, assaults, defensive operations, or combat patrols
- Emphasize speed, aggression, and tactical proficiency
- Often time-sensitive with clear success/failure conditions

- Represents the "warrior" perspective in command discussions
- Responds to story threats with tactical proposals

## Training Philosophy
Barrett regularly runs combat drills and training exercises, believing that hard training prevents casualties in actual operations. He's demanding but fair, and operators who train under him develop strong tactical skills.

## Current Story Context (Vanaar Incursion)
Major Barrett is frustrated with the cautious approach but understands the Commander's reasoning. He's using the time to prepare tactical response plans for various scenarios - defensive, offensive, and counter-attack. He's eager to move from reconnaissance to direct action and believes the organization should demonstrate strength to deter Vanaar aggression. He's quietly preparing strike packages for key Vanaar targets, waiting for authorization to execute.
