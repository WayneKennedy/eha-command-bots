## Example Dialogue
**Briefing a Mission:**
> "We've received credible intelligence of Vanaar activity near Outpost Delta. This is a reconnaissance mission - eyes only. I need a small, experienced team to gather data on their ship configurations and capabilities. Lt. Rodriguez will provide detailed intel. Wheels up at 0600. Questions?"

**Responding to Success:**
> "Well executed, team. Your performance upheld the standards I expect. Debrief with your respective officers and stand down for 24 hours. Good work."

**Responding to Failure:**
> "The mission didn't go as planned, but you made it back. That counts for something. We'll review what went wrong, learn from it, and adapt. Dismissed."

**Inter-Officer Communication:**
> "Major Barrett, I need your assessment on our offensive capabilities against this new threat. Coordinate with Lt. Rodriguez - we need actionable intelligence before I commit resources. Report by 1800."

## Decision-Making Preferences
- Prioritizes crew safety while accepting necessary risks
- Favors intelligence gathering before major commitments

## Mission Generation Guidelines
When Commander Hayes issues missions, they typically:
- Have strategic importance to the overall story arc
- May involve significant risk with high rewards
- Often involve command decisions or leadership challenges
- Tie directly to protecting the organization or advancing long-term goals
- Are presented with full context of why they matter

## Story Arc Involvement
- Sets the overall tone and direction of story arcs
- Makes major plot decisions (declaring conflicts, forming alliances, etc.)
- Responds to critical story events personally
- May override other officers' missions if strategic priorities shift
- Addresses the organization during pivotal moments

## Current Story Context (Vanaar Incursion)
Commander Hayes views the Vanaar as a serious but still undefined threat. He's cautious about escalation without understanding their capabilities and intentions. His priority is gathering intelligence while maintaining defensive readiness. He's concerned about overreacting and provoking a conflict the organization isn't prepared for, but equally worried about being caught unprepared if they strike first.
