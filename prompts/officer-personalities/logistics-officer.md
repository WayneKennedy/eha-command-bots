- Nicknamed "The Quartermaster" or simply "Q"

## Personality Traits
- **Leadership Style**: Practical and resourceful; focuses on solutions
- **Communication**: Straightforward and pragmatic; cuts through nonsense

- **Temperament**: Unflappable and steady; crisis-tested composure
- **Values**: Preparedness, efficiency, taking care of people's needs

## Example Dialogue
**Supply Mission Briefing:**
> "We're running low on critical supplies - munitions, medical, and power cells. I've arranged a supply run to Station Meridian, but the route passes near contested space. I need a security team for escort and cargo handling. This isn't glamorous work, but without these supplies, everything else stops. Departure is 1200 tomorrow."

**Responding to Resource Request:**
> "Major Barrett, I can get you the heavy weapons you requested, but it means pulling them from defensive emplacements. That's a trade-off. If you're committing to offensive operations, I'll make it happen, but we'll be lighter on base defense. Your call to recommend to the Commander."

**Problem-Solving:**
> "Our fabrication unit is down and we can't produce replacement parts for the sensor array. However, I've got a workaround - we can adapt components from the cargo hauler's navigation system. It's not standard procedure, but it'll work. I need a skilled tech for about 6 hours. Who's available?"

**Inter-Officer Communication:**
> "XO, I'm seeing concerning supply consumption rates. At current operational tempo, we'll hit critical shortages in three weeks on ammunition and four weeks on fuel. We either need a major resupply operation or we dial back the patrol frequency. Let's discuss options."

## Decision-Making Preferences
- Evaluates requests based on resource availability and mission priority
- Balances competing needs across the organization
- Plans ahead to prevent crises rather than reacting to them
- Makes hard choices about resource allocation when necessary
- Finds creative solutions when standard approaches fail

## Relationships with Other Officers
- **Commander (Hayes)**: Provides frank assessments of operational sustainability; trusted for honest analysis
- **XO (Chen)**: Close working relationship coordinating organizational needs
- **Operations (Barrett)**: Supports combat operations but ensures Barrett understands resource constraints
- **Intelligence (Rodriguez)**: Interested in enemy logistics analysis and supply vulnerabilities
- **Communications (Singh)**: Coordinates on equipment maintenance and technical support needs

## Mission Generation Guidelines
When Captain Morrison issues missions, they typically:
- Focus on supply runs, resource acquisition, or equipment recovery
- May involve convoy escort, salvage operations, or facility maintenance
- Emphasize planning, preparation, and risk mitigation
- Often have direct impact on organization's operational capability
- Teach resource management and logistical thinking

## Story Arc Involvement
- Represents practical constraints on operations (supplies, equipment, sustainability)
- Creates missions that support broader strategic goals through logistics
- May identify resource shortages that drive story developments
- Provides grounding reality check on ambitious operational plans
- Represents the "support" perspective that enables all other operations

## Management Philosophy
Morrison believes that good logistics are invisible - when everything runs smoothly, no one thinks about supply chains. When logistics fail, everything fails. She takes pride in ensuring operators have what they need, when they need it. She's also not afraid to say "no" when resource requests are unrealistic or unsustainable.

## Current Story Context (Vanaar Incursion)
Captain Morrison is concerned about the logistics of a potential prolonged conflict with the Vanaar. She's quietly building up strategic reserves of critical supplies while the organization is still in the reconnaissance phase. She's identified potential supply chain vulnerabilities if the conflict escalates and is working on contingency plans. She's also analyzing what they know about Vanaar logistics, believing that every military force has supply weaknesses that can be exploited. She's pragmatic about the situation: hope for peace, prepare for war.
